Aim
====

The aim of this project is for me to learn to use Phonegap with existing code.
It is also to make telehack.com mobile, and not just a telnet terminal. I dont want to take this code or anything like that.
I will change stuff periodically to get the mobile app to be more smooth and slick.

The original version does make use of the css style code of telehack.com in order to keep with the same sort of style.
The telnet client was changed to something more formalised.

============
Third Party
============

My application makes use of jsTerm by Peter Nitsch and found on GitHub here: https://github.com/pnitsch/jsTerm
Special Thanks goes to him for creating a solution to the old bbs
!= the new www problem.

See the folder jsTerm_Original_GitHub_Version for his code included in my project.
