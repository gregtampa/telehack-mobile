Aim
====

The aim of this project is for me to learn to use Phonegap with 
existing code.
It is also to make telehack.com mobile, and not just a telnet terminal. 
I dont want to take this code or anything like that.
I will change stuff periodically to get the mobile app to be more 
smooth and slick.

The original version does make use of the css style code of 
telehack.com in order to keep with the same sort of style.
The telnet client was changed to something more formalised.
