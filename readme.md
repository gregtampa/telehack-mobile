Aim
====

The aim of this project is for me to learn to use Phonegap with existing code.
It is also to make telehack.com mobile, and not just a telnet terminal. I dont want to take this code or anything like that.
I will change stuff periodically to get the mobile app to be more smooth and slick.

The original version does make use of the original code of telehack.com.
